# leaflet-challenge
This project is a Leaflet-based visualization of earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It displays global earthquakes from the past 7 days using an interactive map where each earthquake is plotted based on its magnitude and depth, with marker size and color representing their severity. The goal of this project is to provide an educational and impactful way to explore seismic activity in real time using web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and D3.js.
